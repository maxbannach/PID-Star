# PID-Star

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3871800.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3871800)

This program computes for a given graph *G* a tree *T* of minimum depth such that *G* is contained in the closure of *T,* that is, an optimal [treedepth decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree-depth) of *G.*

The tool was developed by *Max Bannach, Sebastian Berndt, Martin Schuster* and *Marcel Wienöbst* as submission for the exact track of [PACE 2020](https://pacechallenge.org/2020/). As such, the input format and I/O behavior is as specified by the PACE.

# Algorithm
The core algorithm is the *positive-instance driven* (PID) dynamic programing framework developed for a general form of graph searching [1]. However, the algorithm presented in [1] works in two phases: it first computes the set of positive instances and, then, solves distance queries on this set. By replacing the reverse breadth-first search by a reverse version of Dijkstra's algorithm we are able to compute these distances on-the-fly. This means the algorithm maintains at any point in time a locally optimal treedepth decomposition for every positive instance (and not just one that can be extended to a global optimal one). If this reverse search has multiple candidates of equal quality, we use a heuristic to determine which candidate is most likely to be good for an optimal global solution and pick this one first, leading to some sort of reverse A* – therefore the name.

# Dependencies
The following open source [crates](https://crates.io) are used. They are automatically downloaded and compiled when the tool is build using *Cargo.*
- [bit-set](https://crates.io/crates/bit-set)
- [bimap](https://crates.io/crates/bimap)

We also use our heuristic [Fluid](https://github.com/maxbannach/Fluid/) to compute upper bounds. The heuristic is open source and was submitted by us to the heuristic track of the PACE. Cargo will automatically download and compile Fluid from the corresponding repository. 

# Build
PID-Star is implemented in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and can simply be build using [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html):

```
cargo build --release
```

# Run
After the build is completed, the tool can either be executed directly via

```
./target/release/pid-star < <mygraph.gr>
```

or by using Cargo

```
cargo run --release < <mygraph.gr>
```

# Optil.io
For the PACE we submitted the static binary generated by `cargo build --release` to [optil.io](https://www.optil.io), that is, the file `./target/release/pid-star`.
